"""Feature views for AceGuard v294 HG2 rebuild (train == serve exactly).

tree_view: per-chunk behavioral aggregates + bucket/entropy fingerprints from
           the base library, plus chunk-size descriptors (raw and log) so the
           model learns the group-size axis (live groups are larger than
           benchmark groups).
wide_view: tree_view merged with the v2 order-statistic aggregates into one
           deduplicated dictionary (the neural member consumes this union).
